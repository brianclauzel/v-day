        <p class="p">So, this year for V-Day we aren't exchanging gifts since we are so broke, so I figured I'd use a little bit of my expertise to make something cool.
            I'm writing you this letter as a webpage so that you can always open it up whenever you are away from home. Love you, boo thang.
        </p>
        <p class="p">First off, I want to say that I know I'm not the best with being vocal about how much I love and appreciate you. It's a weakness that I need to overcome, but know that it's not you or your worthiness to be shown that kind of love. So, I would like to tell you that you are one of the best things to be happen to my life, and I wouldnt be where I am today with out you. You are beautiful and have always been in my eyes since we became friends. Your ability to be light-hearted is under appreciated, but I'd like to say that it's a very unique trait to have and I do find it fitting and lovely, even though I'm not always on your level. You are smart, funny, and a little crazy sometimes, but I wouldn't want you to be any different.</p>
        <p class="p">I hope this short letter conveys more than just a few thoughts or nice things to boost your self esteem, but leaves you with the reminder that I do love you and appreciate you.</p>
        <p class="p">Happy Valentine's Day My Love.</p>
        <p class="p">Brian</p>
